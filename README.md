# Let's-Learn

## Goals:

Let's Learn's goals are to compile multiple teaching sources of various languages and to teach people through code and its comments how to code in their desired language.
The project is currently at its infancy and only three people working on it, focusing on the language Go and a new addition, Scala.
As time goes on, i want this repo to acquire as many languages as possible and achieve a great standard in quality, being able to easily teach others.

- We use multiple trusted sources for each language and cross-examine them to create the content of Let's Learn, with each member specializing in a language.
- If you want to participate in the project or make any fixes/implement new modules or languages, i can add you as a collaborator, just send me a message.
- The exercises are part of the project but still need to have its structure decided.

#### TLDR; Let's Learn is a repo dedicated to teaching others the technologies and languages they want to learn. We have Go and Scala.
