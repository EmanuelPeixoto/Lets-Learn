# Let's-Learn

## Goals:
Let's Learn goals are to compile multiple teaching sources of various languages and teach people through code and it's comments how to code in their desired language.
Right now the project is at its early days and have only me working in it, in the language go
In the future I want this repo to have as much languages as possible and be the best quality as it can be, to be able to easily teach others

If you want to participate in the project or make any fixes/ Implement new modules or languages, I can add you as a collaborator, just send me a message

The exercises part of the project still need to have its structure decided

Let's Learn is a repo dedicated to teaching others the technologies and languages they want to learn
