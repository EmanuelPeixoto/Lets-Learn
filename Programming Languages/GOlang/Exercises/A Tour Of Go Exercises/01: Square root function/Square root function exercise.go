// Square root function exercise
// Now that we learned the basics of functions and loops
// let's try to code a simple function that calculates the square root of any given input
// and stops when the value stops changing by big amounts
// usually square root functions have a starting guess, try changing it and see how much faster
// you can calculate your square root
// Good luck!!
