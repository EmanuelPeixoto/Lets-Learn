// C, just like any other language has data types, they are used to declare the type and size of a given variable
//
// int myInt;
// Here for example myInt is of the type int (used to store intergers) and has a size of 4 bytes
//
// C has the following data types:
//
//      Type                    Size
//
//      int                         at least 2 bytes, usually 4 bytes
//      char                        1 byte
//      float                       4 bytes
//      double                      8 bytes
//      short int                   usually 2 bytes
//      unsigned int                at least u, usually 4 bytes
//      long int                    at least 4, usually 8 bytes
//      long long int               at least 8 bytes
//      unsigned long int           at least 4 bytes
//      unsigned long long int      at least 8 bytes
//      signed char                 1 byte
//      unsigned char               1 byte
//      long double                 at least 10, usually 12 or 16 bytes
//
// We won't commonly use all of these, the ones we'll use most of the time are:
// int, char, float, double
// A more in depth explanation of each data type can be found in the 'Variables' submodule 1
// Here only the commonly used listed will be explained
